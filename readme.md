# Jordantris

## What is it?

**Jordantris** is a knowledge building project created for learning and fun, the following is a list of things that I am hoping to learn or improve by creating this web application.

- Webpack and related configuration from scratch.
- ES6 / Javascript best practices.
- HTML5 game development.
- Nuanced CSS from scratch, creating my own simple and beautiful website to wrap a simple game.
- Web development performance for a 100% client-side application.
