# Jordantris

## What is it?

**Jordantris** is a knowledge building project created for learning and fun, the following is a list of things that I am hoping to learn or improve by creating this web application.

- Webpack and related configuration from scratch.
- ES6 / Javascript best practices.
- HTML5 game development.
- Nuanced CSS from scratch, creating my own simple and beautiful website to wrap a simple game.
- Web development performance for a 100% client-side application.
- Refresher on algorithms and data structures, hopefully I work out some well optimised data storage for game state.

## Getting Started

### Development

- Clone the repository.
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install project dependencies. (learn more about package managers: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start `webpack-dev-server`, this should pick an appropriate open port and run the code in your default browser.

### Deployment

- Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to create a distributable HTML and bundled/minified code deployable.

## Note:
If you wish to pull request code into the repo stick to Yarn for managing packages, rather than mixing standards from NPM.
